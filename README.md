# Github Explorer
There will go my report when I'm done

## Features ideas
- AsyncStorage to keep bookmarks
- Localization
- Sharing to contacts
- Tabs on the preview screen to also see pull requests and issues
- A scrollToTop button
- Login to Github -> star repos, check private repos, create issues, etc.
- pullToRefresh on lists

## Other things to do
- Optimize rendering
- Split the store's tests into several files
- Figure out why the SearchView makes a weird "act" warning in Jest
